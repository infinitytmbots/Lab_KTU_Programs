# Contributing to Lab_KTU_Programs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our repository! To ensure consistency and organization, please follow the steps below when adding your contributions.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Navigate to the Correct Department

- Open the folder corresponding to the department your contribution belongs to. The available departments are:
  - `CSE`
  - `CSE-CYBER SECURITY`
  - `ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE`
  - `ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA SCIENCE`
  - `EC`

### 2. Select the Appropriate Lab

- Inside the department folder, navigate to the folder of the lab where your program should be added.

### 3. Create a New Folder for Your Program

- Inside the lab folder, create a new folder. Name this folder according to the name of your program. For example, if your program is "Matrix Multiplication," name the folder `MatrixMultiplication`.

### 4. Add the Required Files

Inside your program's folder, add the following files:

1. **Program File**
   - This file should contain the code for your program. Name it appropriately based on the programming language used, e.g., `MatrixMultiplication.py` for Python, `MatrixMultiplication.java` for Java, etc.

2. **Output File**
   - This file should contain the output of your program when executed. Name it `output.txt`. If there are multiple outputs, you can create separate files like `output1.txt`, `output2.txt`, etc.

3. **README File**
   - This file should describe what the program does, how it works, and any special instructions for running it. Name it `README.md`.

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

- After adding the files, commit your changes with a descriptive commit message, e.g., `Added Matrix Multiplication program for CSA Lab`.
- Push the changes to the appropriate branch or create a pull request to the main branch.
